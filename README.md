   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Troubleshooting npm:**

   If you encounter any issues with npm dependencies, try running:

   ```bash

   ```

   This command can help resolve common issues with package versions.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your project, including any configuration steps or specific commands needed to run it. For example:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the development server and opens the project in your default web browser.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience problems running `npm start`, ensure:

- Your Node.js and npm versions are up-to-date.
- All dependencies are correctly installed (`npm install`).
- You've run `npm audit fix --force` if npm audit suggests it.

For further assistance, refer to the project's issue tracker or community forums.

## Wireframe

Include a wireframe or UI mockup of your project here. This helps visualize the project's structure and design goals. You can embed an image or provide a link to your wireframe file.

## License

Specify the project's license information here (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). If it's open-source, encourage collaboration and contributions.

### Additional Notes:

- Customize the placeholders (`your-username`, `your-repo`, etc.) with your actual GitHub repository details.
- Ensure your wireframe is accessible and provides a clear overview of your project's design.
- Feel free to add more sections based on your project's specific needs, such as testing instructions, deployment guidelines, or acknowledgments.

This template provides a structured approach to communicating essential information about your project, making it easier for users and collaborators to understand and contribute effectively. Adjust and expand sections as necessary to best showcase your project's unique aspects and requirements.
