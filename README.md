For further assistance, refer to the project's issue tracker or community forums.

## Wireframe
This is the wireframe I used for the project. It's simple, but the website is essentially a copy of the one Codecademy provides. I followed the same design.

Include a wireframe or UI mockup of your project here. This helps visualize the project's structure and design goals. You can embed an image or provide a link to your wireframe file.
